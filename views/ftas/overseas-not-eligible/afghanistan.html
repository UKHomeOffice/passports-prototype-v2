      <h2>How long it takes</h2>
      <p>Your application will take <strong>at least</strong> 6 weeks from when it’s received by Her Majesty’s Passport Office in the UK.</p>
      <p>You may have to attend an interview.</p>
      <p>Applications will take longer if:</p>
      <ul class="list-bullet">
        <li>HM Passport Office needs to ask you for more information or documents</li>
        <li>the photographs you send are rejected</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Don’t book any travel until you have a valid passport. If you need to travel more urgently, you may be able to apply for an <a href="https://www.gov.uk/emergency-travel-document">Emergency Travel Document</a>.</p>

      <h2>Cost</h2>
      <p>You’ll have to pay a fee for your passport and a courier fee of £24.72.</p>
      <p>The courier fee pays for your passport to be sent securely to the UK Visa Application Centre where you applied for you to collect.</p>
