<p>You need to ask someone to confirm your identity.</p>
<p>They'll need to enter their UK passport details, look at your photo and answer a few questions. They don't need to sign your photo.</p>
<p>You can do this when you've paid for your passport. We'll also send you an email with instructions.</p>
