<h1>What you need to do</h1>

<p>Before we can print the new passport, you need to:


  <ol>
      <li>
        <h2>1. Ask someone to confirm {{> partials-applicant-yours-the-applicants}} identity</h2>
          They can do this online. Sign into your application to provide their name and email. You'll need your application reference: <strong>PEX 319 825 680X</strong></p>

      </li>
      <li>
      <h2>2. Get your documents ready</h2>
      <p>We can only receive your documents after {{> partials-applicant-yours-the-applicants}} identity has been confirmed.  We'll let you know when and where to send them. </p>
      </li>
  </ol>


  <div role="note" aria-label="Information" class="panel panel-border-wide application-notice info-notice">
      <p>If you need to sign in later, the details are in your confirmation email.</p>
  </div>
