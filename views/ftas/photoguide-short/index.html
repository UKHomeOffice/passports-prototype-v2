                <p>You can now take your passport photo at home with a friend.</p>
                <p>It’s quick and easy, giving you more time to get ready for your travels.</p>
                <h3>Use a plain background</h3>
                <p>A light grey or cream wall works best and make sure there are no objects behind you.</p>
                <h3>Get the lighting right</h3>
                <p>Natural light is best but you can use other lighting. Just make sure the light doesn’t cast shadows on your face.</p>
                <h3>Stand in the right position</h3>
                <p>You need to stand away from the background to avoid shadows behind you. Your friend needs to be able to fit your head, shoulders and upper body into the photo.</p>
                <h3>Keep your face clear</h3>
                <p>Make sure your whole face is visible. Keep your hair away from your face and brushed down. Headwear worn for religious or medical reasons can be left on.</p>
                <h3>Now get ready</h3>
                <p>Look straight at the camera and try to keep a plain expression. Smiling by accident is a
                common mistake, others include: hair getting in the way, shadows on your face, glasses covering eyes, glare on glasses and blurry photos. Don’t worry if it takes a few goes to get it right.
                When you get a good photo upload it online and complete your application. Now relax and get planning for your travels.</p>
