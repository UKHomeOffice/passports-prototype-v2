        <h1>You need 2 printed photos</h1>

        <p>Your digital photo didnâ€™t meet the rules for UK passport photos.</p>
      </header>

      <h2>What you need to do</h2>

      <p>You need to take 2 printed passport photos to your collection appointment. You can get printed photos from a photo shop or a booth. There is a photo booth at the passport office.</p>

      <div class="panel panel-border-narrow">
        <p>You don't need to get anybody to sign the back of your photos.</p>
      </div>

      <h2>Your collection appointment</h2>

      <p><strong>Tuesday 30 May 2018<br></strong>at <strong>1:00pm</strong></p>

      <p>London HM Passport Office<br>
        Globe House<br>
        89 Eccleston Square<br>
        London<br>
        SW1 1PN</p>

      <p>Follow signs to the main reception and tell staff at the check-in desk you've arrived. Don't go to the collections desk.</p>

      <p>It takes longer to print your passport without a digital photo. You'll have to go back to the same passport office up to 4 working hours later to get your new passport.</p>

      <p>If you can't go to your collection appointment, <a href="/">contact us</a>. Your new appointment details will be sent to you by email.</p>

      <h2>What you need to bring</h2>
      <p>You must bring: </p>
      <ul class="list-bullet list-bullet-header-spacing">
        <li>your old passport</li>
        <li>2 printed passport photos</li>
      </ul>

      <p>If someone is collecting your new passport for you, they need to bring:
        <ul class="list list-bullet">
          <li>your old passport
          <li>your 2 printed passport photos</li>
          <li>a signed and dated letter from you, confirming their full name and giving them permission to collect your passport</li>
          <li>proof of their identity, for example a driving licence or passport</li>
        </ul>
      </p>


      <div class="panel-important" style="margin:-10px 0 10px 0;">
        <p>Your old passport will be cancelled on the day of your collection appointment. You won't be able to use it.</p>
