    <h2>Discount on the application fee</h2>

    <p>It isn't currently possible to apply online in Welsh, so you'll get a refund of Â£9.50. This is the same as the discount given for applying online in English.</p> 

    <p>We'll give you the refund within 20 working days of approving your application.</p>
