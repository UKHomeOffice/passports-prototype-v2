              <h2>How to get your digital photo</h2>

              <p>You can choose from 3 ways:</p>
              <ol class="list-number">
                <li>Get a friend to take one. They can use a phone, tablet or digital camera. We’ll show you how to take a good passport photo and upload it.</li>
                <li>Go to a photo shop. You’ll get a digital copy of your photo. Some shops can also give you a photo code. We’ll show you how to use the code to retrieve your digital photo.</li>
                <li>Go to a booth. From some booths in the UK and abroad, you'll be able to get a photo code with your printed photos. We’ll show you how to use the code to retrieve your digital photo.</li>
              </ol>

              <h2>What your digital photo must show</h2>
