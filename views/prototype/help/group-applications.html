{{$content}}

<p>If you're applying as part of a family or couple, send all the documents together in the same envelope.</p>

<p>This helps to keep your applications together, which is important if you have to send the same document for more than one application.</p>


<h2 style="margin-top: 1.875em !important; margin-bottom: .83333em !important;">How to send your documents</h2>

<p>Put all the documents together in a strong envelope. List each application reference number on the front, above the address.</p>


<h2 style="margin-top: 1.875em !important; margin-bottom: .83333em !important;">Where to send your documents</h2>

<p>If each person in the group has been given a different address, you can send the documents to any of the addresses we've given you.</p>


<h2 style="margin-top: 1.875em !important; margin-bottom: .83333em !important;">If someone has to have their identity confirmed</h2>

<p>Don't send the documents until their identity has been confirmed. You'll get an email when that's complete and we're ready to receive the documents.<p>
