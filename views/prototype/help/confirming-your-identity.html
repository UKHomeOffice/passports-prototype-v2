<h2>How to confirm someone's identity</h2>

<p>For applications with a digital photo, you can confirm someone's identity online. You don't need to sign a printed photo.</p>

<h3>What the applicant needs to do</h3>

  <p>As the applicant, you need to:</p>
  <ol class="list-number">
    <li>Check <a href="./who-can-confirm">who can confirm your identity</a></li>
    <li>Contact the person before giving their details to HM Passport Office</li>
    <li>Make sure they know your address and date of birth, including the year</li>
    <li>Sign into your application to enter the person's name and email</li>
  </ol>

<p>If you're applying for a child, the person you ask must be able to confirm where the child was born as well as their parents' names and years of birth.

<h3>What the person confirming an identity needs to do</h3>

<p>As the person confirming someone's identity, you'll receive an email from HM Passport Office. The email includes a link and a reference to sign in online.</p>

<p>You'll need to:</p>
<ol class="list-number">
  <li>Enter the reference from the email and the applicant's date of birth</li>
  <li>Provide your UK passport details and current address</li>
  <li>Answer a few questions about how you know the applicant</li>
  <li>Confirm some of the applicant's details</li>
  <li>Check a digital passport photo</li>
</ol>
<p>This takes about 10 minutes.</p>
<p>If the applicant is a child, you'll need to answer a few questions about how you know the person making their application. We need to confirm the person applying has parental responsibility.</p>


<!-- <ol class="list-number">
  <li style="margin-bottom:15px">The applicant should have contacted you before giving your details to HM Passport Office. They need to give you some personal information to help you sign in online.</li>
  <li style="margin-bottom:15px">You'll get an email from HM Passport Office with a link and a reference to sign in online.</li>
  <li style="margin-bottom:15px">Once we've confirmed who you are, we'll ask a few questions about how you know the applicant. We'll also show you a passport photo.</li>
</ol> -->

<!-- <p id="how-it-works">You'll need to use a secure device. It takes about 10 minutes. </p> -->


<!-- this isn't needed for inline guidance  <h2>When you need to do this</h2>

<p>You'll need to ask someone to confirm your identity if you're:</p>

<ul class="list list-bullet">
    <li>applying for a first passport</li>
    <li>replacing a lost or stolen passport</li>
    <li>renewing a passport for a child aged 11 or younger</li>
    <li>renewing a passport that expired some time ago</li>
</ul>
