<p>When a person applies for a UK passport, Her Majesty's Passport Office sometimes needs to check that they are who they claim to be. <br><br>The person applying for the passport must ask someone they know well to confirm their identity.</p><p><span style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: 700;">To confirm someone's identity, you must live in the UK and:</span></p>

<ul><li>have known the applicant personally for at least 2 years, for example as a friend or neighbour</li>
<li>and work in or be retired from a <a href="/govuk">recognised profession</a></li>
<li>and have a current UK passport</li>

</ul>

<p>You must not be related to, in a relationship with or living at the same address as the person applying.</p>
