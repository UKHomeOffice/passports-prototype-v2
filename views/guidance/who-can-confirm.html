{{$content}}

<p>For some passport applications, you need to ask someone to confirm your identity. This confirms an application belongs to you and helps protect your identity.</p>

<p>The person you ask can do this online &ndash; they don't need to sign a printed photo.</p>

<h2>Who can do this</h2>

To confirm someone's identity, you need to:</p>
<ul class="list-bullet">
  <li>be 18 or older</li>
  <li>and live in the UK</li>
  <li>and have a current UK passport</li>
  <li>and work in or be retired from a <a href="/guidance/recognised-professions" target="_blank">recognised profession</a></li>
</ul>
<p>You need to have known the applicant personally for at least 2 years, for example as a friend, neighbour or colleague.</p>

<div role="note" aria-label="Information" class="panel panel-border-wide application-notice info-notice">
<p>If you're confirming a child's identity, you need to have known the person making the application personally for at least 2 years.</p>
</div>

<h2>When can't you do this</h2>
<p>You can't confirm someones's identity if you're:</p>
<ul class="list-bullet">
  <li>related to them</li>
  <li>in a relationship with them</li>
  <li>living at the same address</li>
  <li>working for HM Passport Office</li>
</ul>

<h2>How to confirm someone's identity online</h2>

<ol class="list-number">
  <li style="margin-bottom:15px">The applicant should have contacted you before giving your details to HM Passport Office. They need to give you some personal information to help you sign in online.</li>
  <li style="margin-bottom:15px">You'll get an email from HM Passport Office with a link and a reference to sign in online.</li>
  <li style="margin-bottom:15px">Once we've confirmed who you are, we'll ask a few questions about how you know the applicant. We'll also show you a passport photo.</li>
</ol>

<p id="how-it-works">You'll need to use a secure device. It takes about 10 minutes. </p>


<!-- this isn't needed for inline guidance  <h2>When you need to do this</h2>
