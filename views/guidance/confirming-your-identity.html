<p>You'll need someone to check your photo looks like you and confirm your identity if you're applying for a:</p>

<ul class="list list-bullet">
    <li>first passport</li>
    <li>replacement of a lost or stolen passport</li>
    <li>renewal for a child aged 11 or under</li>
    <li>renewal of a passport that expired some time ago</li>
</ul>

<p>It's an important part of protecting your identity. It helps us confirm the passport application belongs to you.</p>

<br>

<h2>How it works</h2>

<p>After you've completed your application details and paid, we'll ask you to provide the details of someone who can confirm your identity.</p>

<p>We'll send an email to the person you choose to do this, containing a link to go online. They'll need to enter their UK passport details to log in.</p>

<p>We'll ask them to check your photo and confirm it looks like you. We'll also ask them to confirm some details about you.

<p>We'll send you an email after they've confirmed your identity. If there's a problem or they don't reply, we'll ask you to nominate someone else.</p>

<br>

<h2>Who you can ask</h2>

<p>The person you ask must work in or be retired from <a href="recognised-professions">a recognised profession</a> and:</p>

<ul class="list list-bullet">
    <li>have known you personally for at least 2 years, for example as a friend, neighbour or colleague</li>
    <li>live in the UK</li>
    <li>have a current UK passport</li>
</ul>

<p>They can't be in a relationship with you, live at your address or be related to you by birth or marriage.</p>
