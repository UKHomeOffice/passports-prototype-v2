    <h1>Get someone to confirm your identity</h1>
{{/header}}

{{$content}}

<p>You'll need someone to confirm your identity if you're applying for a:</p>

<ul class="list-bullet">
    <li>first passport</li>
    <li>replacement of a lost or stolen passport</li>
    <li>renewal of a passport for a child aged 11 or under</li>
    <li>renewal of a passport if your appearance has changed so much you can't be recognised from your existing passport</li>
</ul>
<br>

<h2>Who you can ask</h2>
<p>They must:</p>

<ul class="list-bullet">
    <li>have known you personally for at least 2 years, for example as a friend, neighbour or colleague</li>
    <li>work in or be retired from <a href="recognised-professions">a recognised profession</a></li>
    <li>live in the UK</li>
    <li>have a current UK or Irish passport</li>
</ul>

<p>They can't be:</p>

<ul class="list-bullet">
    <li>related to you by birth or marriage</li>
    <li>be in a relationship with you</li>
    <li>live at your address</li>
</ul>
<br>

<h2>How it works</h2>
<p>You need to contact the person before we send them an email. You need to tell them:</p>
<ul class="list-bullet">
    <li>date of birth</li>
    <li>current address</li>
</ul>

<p>We'll send them an email with a link to go online. They'll need to enter their UK passport details, look at a photo and answer a few questions.</p>


<p>We may contact them for more information. Your application may be delayed if they're not available, for example they're on holiday.</p>
