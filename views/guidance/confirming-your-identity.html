    <h1>How to confirm someone's identity online</h1>
{{/header}}

{{$content}}

<p>For passport applications with digital photos, the applicant can ask someone to confirm their identity online.</p>

<p>HM Passport Office will tell the applicant if we need to confirm their identity. It isn't necessary for all applications.</p>

<h2>What the applicant needs to do</h2>

<p>The applicant needs to ask someone who meets the <a href= href "guidance/who-can-confirm"> rules to confirm someone's identity</a>.</p>

<p>They must contact the person before giving their contact details to HM Passport Office. They need to sign into their account to enter the person's name and email.</p>

<p>The person they ask must be able to confirm the applicant's address and date of birth, including the year.</p>
<p>If the applicant is a child, the person they ask must be able to confirm where the child was born as well as their parents' names and years of birth.


<h2>What the person confirming their identity needs to do</h2>

<p>The person confirming the applicant's identity will receive an email from HM Passport Office. The email includes a link and a reference to sign in online.</p>

<p>They will need to:</p>
<ol class="list-number">
  <li>Enter the reference from the email and the applicant's date of birth</li>
  <li>Provide their UK passport details and address</li>
  <li>Answer a few questions about how they know the applicant</li>
  <li>Confirm some of the applicant's details</li>
  <li>Check a passport photo</li>
</ol>
<p>This takes about 10 minutes. They don't need to sign a printed photo. </p>

<!-- <ol class="list-number">
  <li style="margin-bottom:15px">The applicant should have contacted you before giving your details to HM Passport Office. They need to give you some personal information to help you sign in online.</li>
  <li style="margin-bottom:15px">You'll get an email from HM Passport Office with a link and a reference to sign in online.</li>
  <li style="margin-bottom:15px">Once we've confirmed who you are, we'll ask a few questions about how you know the applicant. We'll also show you a passport photo.</li>
</ol> -->

<!-- <p id="how-it-works">You'll need to use a secure device. It takes about 10 minutes. </p> -->


<!-- this isn't needed for inline guidance  <h2>When you need to do this</h2>

<p>You'll need to ask someone to confirm your identity if you're:</p>

<ul class="list list-bullet">
    <li>applying for a first passport</li>
    <li>replacing a lost or stolen passport</li>
    <li>renewing a passport for a child aged 11 or younger</li>
    <li>renewing a passport that expired some time ago</li>
</ul>
