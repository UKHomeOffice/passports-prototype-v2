{{/header}}

{{$content}}

<p>For some kinds of applications, you'll need to ask someone to confirm your identity. You may also need to do this if there's a problem with your photo.

<p>This helps protect your identity and confirm the application belongs to you.</p>

<h2>How it works</h2>

<p>If you've applied with a digital photo, someone can confirm your identity online. They don't need to sign a printed photo.</p>

<ol class="list list-number">

<li>After completing your application, you'll sign in to check who can do this and provide their details.</li>
<li>We'll send them an email with a link to go online. They will need their UK passport details and your date of birth.</li>
<li>They will see your digital photo and answer a few questions about how they know you. It takes about 10 minutes.</li>

</ol>

<p>If there's a problem or they don't do this, you'll need to ask someone else. You can only ask one person at a time. </p>


<h2>Who can do this</h2>

<p>You need to ask someone who lives in the UK and:</p>

<ul class="list list-bullet">
    <li>has known you personally for at least 2 years, for example as a friend, neighbour or colleague</li>
    <li>and works in or is retired from a <a href="recognised-professions">a recognised profession</a></li>
    <li>and has a current UK passport</li>
</ul>

<p>They must not be related to you, in a relationship with you or living at the same address. They must not work at Her Majesty's Passport Office.</p>

<!-- <h2>When you need to do this</h2>

<p>You'll need to ask someone to confirm your identity if you're:</p>

<ul class="list list-bullet">
    <li>applying for a first passport</li>
    <li>replacing a lost or stolen passport</li>
    <li>renewing a passport for a child aged 11 or younger</li>
    <li>renewing a passport that expired some time ago</li>
</ul>
 -->
