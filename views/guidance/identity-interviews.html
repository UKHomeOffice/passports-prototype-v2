{{$content}}

<p>You may be asked for an interview at a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/passport-interview-office" target="_blank">passport office</a> if you've never had a UK passport before, or you're renewing an old style passport with a dark blue cover.</p>

<p>The interview will help us confirm your identity and that the passport application belongs to you.</p>


<br>

<h2>What happens at the interview</h2>

<p>Your appointment will last about 30 minutes.</p>

<p>We'll ask you some simple questions that someone trying to steal your identity may not know. We'll also check your photo looks like you.</p>

<p>You can bring a friend or relative with you to the office, but they'll have to wait in reception while you have your interview.</p>
<br>

<h2>Booking your appointment</h2>
<p>We'll send you a letter asking you to phone for an appointment. When you call, tell us if you need a:</p>

<ul class="list-bullet">
    <li>sign language interpreter</li>
    <li>private interview room because you don't want to uncover your face in public</li>
</ul>
<br>

<h2>After the interview</h2>
<p>You won't get your new passport on the day. We'll carry out final checks on your application before we send your new passport.</p>
