    </header>

   <h2>What you need to do</h2>

        <p>You need to take 2 printed passport photos to your collection appointment. You can get printed photos from a photo shop or a booth. There is a photo booth at the passport office.</p>

      <h2>Your collection appointment</h2>

          <p><strong>Tuesday 30 May 2017</strong></br>
          at <strong>1:00pm</strong></span>
          <p></p>
          <p>London HM Passport Office</br>

          <p>It takes longer to print your passport without a digital photo. You'll have to go back to the same passport office up to 4 working hours later to get your new passport.</p>

          <p>You must bring: </p>

            <li>your old passport</li>
            <li>2 printed passport photos</p>
