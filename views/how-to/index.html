            <div class="panel panel-border-wide alert-default">
              <p>Make sure your photo meets these rules. If it doesn't, you may have problems with your application or when you travel.</p>

              <h2>How to get your digital photo</h2>

              <p>You can choose from 3 ways:</p>
              <ol class="list-number">
                <li>Get a friend to take one. They can use a phone, tablet or digital camera. We’ll show you how to take a good passport photo and upload it.</li>
                <li>Go to a photo shop. You’ll get a digital copy of your photo. Some shops can also give you a photo code. We’ll show you how to use the code to retrieve your digital photo.</li>
                <li>Go to a booth. From some booths in the UK and abroad, you'll be able to get a photo code with your printed photos. We’ll show you how to use the code to retrieve your digital photo.</li>
              </ol>

              <h2>What your digital photo must show</h2>

              <p>If you get someone to take your photo they need to fit your head, shoulders and upper body into the photo. Don't crop your photo &ndash; we'll do it for you.</p>


              <h3>Your photo must:</h3>

              <ul  class="list-bullet">

                <li>be taken in the last month</li>

              </ul>

              <h3>In your photo you must:</h3>


              <ul  class="list-bullet">

                <li>have a plain expression and your mouth closed</li>
                <li>have your eyes open and visible</li>
                <li>not have hair covering your eyes</li>
                <li>not wear anything on your head (unless it’s for religious or medical reasons)</li>
              </ul>
